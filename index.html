        <li>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born in Makkah in the year of 570 AC, also known as the year of the elephant. His father was Abdullah the son of Abdul Muttalib the son of Hashim and his mother, Amina, was the daughter of Wahab. Thus Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a scion of the noble Bani Hashim clan a sub-division of the large Quraish tribe, descended from Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him) the elder son of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him). He was a posthumous child, as his father Abdullah had died three months before his birth.</li>
        <li>
          The young Muhammad (peace be upon him) was put under the care of a noble wet-nurse called Halima bint Hareth As-Saadiyah, as it was their custom. After four years Halima brought back the child to his mother and grandfather. When Muhammad (peace be upon him) attained the age of 6, his mother died due to sudden illness. His grandather, Abdul Muttalib, then took upon himself the task of bringing up the young orphan, never letting him feel the slightest discormfort. As the time flew by, elevating Muhammad (peace be upon him) to the age of 8, his grandfather handed over the guardianship to his son, Abu Talib, as he himself laid helplessly on his deathbed.

          Growing up in his uncle's house, he received zero education, hence he was illiterate. In his teen years, he used to work as a shephered. After reaching the age of 20, he indulged himself in bussiness and earned the title of Al-Amin (The Trustworth) and As-Sadiq (The Truthful). A wealthy businesswoman, named Khadija bint Khuwaylid, used to hire businessman and give them goods to sell in Bilad al Shaam (modern day Syria). Khadija once heard about the reputation of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and hired him. After doing couple of business deals with Khadija (May Allah be pleased with her), Khadija got more impressed by Muhammad's honest character, and decided to marry him. Muhammad (peace be upon him), at the age of 25, got married to Khadija (may Allah be pleased with her).

          At the age of 40, while he was in the cave Hira, he was rewarded with prophethood. Angel Jibreel brought to him the first revelation consisting of Surah Al-'Alaq (The clot), Verse: 1-5. As this was his first time, he got so overwhelmed that he returned home to his wife and told her, "cover me up, cover me up." After few deep breaths, prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrated to Khadija what had transpired. Khadija comforted her husband, <strong>“Under no circumstances should you fear for your life. By Allah. Allah will not ruin you. Allah will not disgrace you, because you maintain very good relationships with your family. You honor your guests. You carry the weight & burdens of the people. You take care of people who are less fortunate. You are always looking for any good cause to aid in.”</strong>

          For 3 years, prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shared the truth with his close friends and associates. Then, about 613, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was commanded to make the Message public; “Warn the closest of your tribespeople (your khandan, your ashira, extended family) & whoever follows you from the believers, then be humble to them.” As he began to call people to Truth, Makkan authorities, with all their pride and arrogance, started considering him a dangerous nuisance, albeit they knew that this Message was something really Great and it couldn't be from a human.

        <li>
          Holding firmly to truth and justice, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) continued to spread the Message with love and patience. Seeing the undeniable Truth and Prophet's courteous character, people began to accept the Message. In 622, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), migrated to Madinah with his companions, where many people joined the fold of Islam. He created brotherhood between all the Muslims, and encouraged them to behave courteously towards everyone. During his stay in Madinah, series of battles were fought between Madinah and Makkah.

          In 630, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had been granted victory by All-Mighty Allah, and he marched towards Makkah with 10,000 Muslims. Upon entering the Makkah, everyone was granted safety by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and no one was forced to became a Muslim. The remaining two and a half years of his life, he witnessed the rapid conversion of the Arab tribes to the religion of Truth. When Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) passed away, in 632, he was a just, loving and caring ruler of all of Southern Arabia.
